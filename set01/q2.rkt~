;; A FurLength is represented as a Real.
;; A BarLength is represented as a Real.

;; furlongs-to-barleycorns: FurLength -> BarLength
;; GIVEN: a length in furlongs.
;; RETURNS: the equivalent length in barleycorns.
;; EXAMPLES:
;; (furlongs-to-barleycorns 5) = 118800
;; (furlongs-to-barleycorns 0.2) = 4752
;; DESIGN STRATEGY: Using the length relation between furlong and barleycorn.
