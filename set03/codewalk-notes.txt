Problem Set #: set03
Question Codewalked: - 2

Design Grade: - B
Presentation Grade: - B
================

Examples and Tests:

--  100% test coverage achieved. However these many test cases were not able to find the problem with the submission.

================

Data Design:

-- Design choice can be improved. The Student during code walk could suggest that the design could have been fairly improvised

-- missing/incomplete interpretation.  
— Mistakes in the data design for World. Why we need Mouse in the World? 
- Why we have to store both x, y and dx and dy
- How did you represent the location of the mouse in your data definition? Is the location absolute or relative (relative to what?)- Not clear
- In World,  Nonnegative-Integer what does this data type imply? 
-- missing/incomplete/wrong invariants in data definitions
x, y: Real the position of the center of the ball in 
;;               the scene How can it be Real?

-- missing/incorrect templates. 

================

Contract/Purpose Statement/Design Strategy:

-- missing/incorrect contracts. Contract violation, racket-after-mouseevent is accepting a World rather Racket

— ball-after-tick:Racket Ball World-rally? World-tick-number-> Ball: What are you trying to do? Incorrect contract and DataTypes

path-x-at-racket-vy : Racket-vy Ball -> Real. What do you mean by the data type Racket-vy? Incorrect contract. Kindly refer slides.

-- missing/incomplete/misleading purpose statements. Multiple instances, incomplete purpose statement with wrong contracts

-- purpose statement does not mention one of the arguments. Should have meaningful purpose  statements

================

Presentation:

-- student has difficulty understanding questions that are asked

-- student has difficulty answering questions


================

Other:

Suggestion: Error messages in the test cases. Understand the purpose of testing your own code. Program review is MUST

Use helper functions wherever appropriate
