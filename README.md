# Program-Design-Paradigms
The course has two distinct objectives. First, it ensures all MS students have developed basic skills in program design, from problem analysis to developing test suites, using several program design paradigms. Second, the course introduces students to programming as a people discipline. Students will present code to review panels and learn to cope with an evolving code base. 
 
The course uses Racket(function programming language) as the primary programming language, and also covers functional programming features of Java.
